# Causal Inference üìäüîó

This repository offers hands-on exercises that delve into the core principles and methods of causal inference‚Äîcovering treatment effect estimation, confounding and selection bias, matching techniques, and regression-based adjustments. The notebooks simulate realistic observational scenarios where uncovering true cause-and-effect relationships is essential for confident, data-driven business decisions.

Drawing from experience at the crossroads of analytics and consulting, this collection strengthens my ability to formulate precise causal questions, implement robust statistical approaches, and translate findings into clear, actionable business insights. Each method is rigorously applied, visually explored, and statistically validated to highlight its strengths and limitations.

## üí° Why This Matters

In business analytics, *understanding why* something occurs is often more critical than *what* happens. This project embodies a commitment to causal rigor‚Äîmoving beyond correlation to uncover actionable insights that reduce uncertainty and guide strategic decisions.

Applicable to marketing impact analysis, policy assessment, and product experimentation, causal inference sharpens analytical rigor, builds stakeholder trust, and enhances storytelling grounded in evidence. These exercises showcase my approach to integrating statistical precision with business acumen for meaningful impact.
