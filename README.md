# Causal Inference

This repository contains hands-on exercises exploring the fundamentals of causal inference â€” including treatment effect estimation, selection bias, matching methods, and regression-based adjustments. These notebooks simulate real-world observational settings where identifying true cause-and-effect relationships is key to making informed business decisions.

As someone working at the intersection of analytics and consulting, Iâ€™ve used this series to strengthen my ability to ask the right causal questions, implement appropriate statistical techniques, and communicate findings in business terms. Each method is tested, explained, and evaluated using both visual and statistical tools.

## ðŸ”§ Tools Used
- Python (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-learn)
- Causal Inference Libraries: `DoWhy`, `EconML`
- Jupyter Notebook for modeling and exploration

## ðŸ§ª Whatâ€™s Covered

| Topic | Concepts Explored |
|-------|-------------------|
| **Potential Outcomes & ATE** | Introduction to causal frameworks and estimating Average Treatment Effects |
| **Selection Bias & Confounding** | Understanding how omitted variable bias and confounders affect estimation |
| **Matching Methods** | Propensity score matching and nearest neighbor methods |
| **Regression Adjustment** | Using OLS and multivariate regression to control for covariates |
| **Evaluation & Interpretation** | Visual and numerical interpretation of causal results and assumptions |

## ðŸ’¡ Why This Matters

In business settings, understanding *why* something happened is often more important than knowing *what* happened. This project reflects my commitment to going beyond correlationâ€”focusing instead on uncovering true causal relationships that drive better decision-making.

Whether applied to marketing lift analysis, policy evaluation, or product changes, causal inference methods are powerful tools that sharpen strategic thinking and reduce decision risk. These exercises help demonstrate how I approach **analytical rigor, stakeholder trust, and storytelling grounded in evidence** â€” all of which are crucial in both analytics consulting and data science roles.
